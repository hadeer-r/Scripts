# Description
This script extracts a YouTube playlist into a markdown file, converting each video into a task. It helps you organize YouTube playlists that you want to study and track your study progress.

## How It Works:
The script takes the name and URL of each video in a playlist and lists them as tasks in a markdown file.

1. Enter the URL of the playlist.
2. Provide the name of the markdown file where you want to save the playlist (make sure it has the `.md` extension).
3. The script will generate an organized plan, listing each video as a task in the markdown file.

You can find an example file generated by this script here: [example](example).

## Prerequisites
1. Install the `yt-dlp` tool. You can find installation instructions here: [yt-dlp GitHub](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## Usage Scenario
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod u+x youtube_playlist_to_md.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./youtube_playlist_to_md.sh
   ```

3. Enter the playlist URL.
4. Provide the name of the markdown file you want to create.
